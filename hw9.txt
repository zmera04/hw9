1. What is SQL? What are relational databases?
    SQL is a language for database creation and manipulation. SQL is used to create dynamic websites-- storing data from which
    content is pulled from. Relational databases are essentially tables-- similar to an excel spreadsheet. Columns store a
    characteristic of items in a table, and rows group data in several columns representing an item.

4. What is a PDO in PHP? Why do we need to use prepared statements?
    PDO, or PHP Data Objects, allow for consistent ways to access databases. PDOs also ensure that accessing a database is 
    safe, through prepared statements. Prepared statements protect databases from SQL injections, even if an input is not
    escaped properly. In the preparation step, a SQl statement template is created and sent to the database, with certain values
    (called parameters) left unspecified. The database parses, compiles, and performs query optimization on the statement, 
    storing the result without executing the statement. In the execution step, the parameter's values are set, and the database
    executes the statement-- the statement can be executed several times, with different values in the parameters. Due to
    prepared statement's independence from external inputs, SQL injections cannot occur.
